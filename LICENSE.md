## GeNN Contributor Standard License 1.1.0
**This license is designed for material stored in specific GeNN repositories, namely the user submission repositories as part of the GenGeNN project. This license must not be modified and cannot be used for any repositories not directly related to GeNN.**  
In the context of this license:  
  - Internal material means any publicly available material or code owned, endorsed (but not warranted) and directly maintained by the GeNN team, including that stored in repositories on GitHub as part of the GeNN-team or GenGeNN projects.
  - External material means any material or code that is not endorsed (or warranted) by the GeNN team. This includes any material not in the master branches of any internal git repositories.
  - Author means the entity that created or submitted any material in a format that makes it accessible to the general public.
### The following clauses comprise this license:
1. Using internal material with this license  
  All the material in these repositories is free to use. While the GenGeNN team will endeavour to make all material in these repositories as safe and appropriate to purpose as feasibly possible, no warranty of use or responsibility for damage is provided. To help achieve this goal, the master branch of these repositories will be moderated. Any material under this license may be relicensed under any other license.
2. Using external material with this license  
  Neither the author or the GeNN team provide any warranty for any of the material. The author, however, should endeavour where possible to make any of their material work for its specified purpose, and clearly state where material is no longer maintained to the extent that it does not remain for for purpose.
3. Submitting material  
  By submitting material to the GeNN project, either through direct interaction, submission to a repository or other reasonable means, the ownership rights of this material is too transferred to the GeNN team. The team will endeavour to preserve any notice of the original author's identity stored within any material, however this may not be practicable in all circumstances. Submission must be made under a copy of this license.
4. Responsibility of reporting
  If any mistakes, bugs or otherwise faults are discovered in the material or in its execution, the user should endeavour to notify the GeNN team wherever possible.
