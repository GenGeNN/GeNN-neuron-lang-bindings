GeNN Contributor Standard License 1.0.0
This license is designed for code stored in specific GeNN repositories, namely the user submission repositories as part of the GenGeNN project. This license must not be modified and cannot be used for any repositories not directly related to GeNN.
In this context:
  - Internal code means any publicly available code owned, endorsed (but not warranted) and directly maintained by the GeNN team, including that stored in repositories on GitHub as part of the GeNN-team or GenGeNN projects.
  - External code means any code that is not endorsed (or warranted) by the GeNN team. This includes any code not in the master branches of any internal git repositories.
  - Author means the entity that created or submitted any code in a format that makes it accessible to the general public.
1. Using internal code with this license
  All the code in these repositories is free to use. While the GenGeNN team will endeavour to make all code in these repositories as safe and appropriate to purpose as feasibly possible, no warranty of use or responsibility for damage is provided. To help achieve this goal, the master branch of these repositories will be moderated.
2. Using external code with this license
  Neither the author or the GeNN team provide any warranty for any of the code. The author, however, should endeavour where possible to make any of their code work for its specified purpose, and clearly state where code is no longer maintained to the extent that it does not remain fir for purpose.
3. Submitting code
  By submitting code to the GeNN project, either through direct interaction, submission to a repository or other reasonable means, the ownership rights of this code is too transferred to the GeNN team. The team will endeavour to preserve any notice of the original author's identity stored within any code, however this may not be practicable in all circumstances. Submission must be made under a copy of this license.
4. Modifying code
  Anyone with access to this code may make or suggest any modifications to their own copy of the code. However, the license must not be changed, with the exception of installing a newer, compatible version of the same license. Any modifications that resolve any problems or bugs in the code should be submitted to the GeNN team according to guidelines if possible, and if not, the details of these errors should be submitted alone.
